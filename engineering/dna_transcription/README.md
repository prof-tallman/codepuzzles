## AI Restriction ##
Students are allowed to use AI LLMs such as ChatGPT to lookup basic features and examples within the programming language. For example, somebody might ask AI how to read a text file. The AI would most likely respond by explaining how to use functions like `read` (for Python) or `ReadTextFile` for C#.

However, students are prohibited from giving the AI with any information about the project. If the AI guesses the context of the assignment and provides sample code, please try to ignore this information. Basically, studnets may use AI as a nice interface to the official documentation but may not use AI to write any of the project.
