These stages are friendly suggestions to help new programmers. Skilled students are allowed to complete the project in any order; and they might find better ways to solve the requirements.
1. ***AI Does My HW***: Write a function that will perform a conversion from US Dollars to another currency using an exchange rate dictionary. Hardcode the dollar amount, the new currency type, and the exchange rate dictionary.
2. ***Script Kiddie***: Rather than hardcode the exchange rate dictionary, look up the exchange rates from a file on disk. A sample file is provided; copy it to an appropriate local directory.
3. ***Professional***: Change the program so that it takes the name of the foreign currency and a dollar amount as command line arguments. 
4. ***1337 H@cker***: TODO ???
5. ***BONUS***: Expand your program so that it no longer assumes that the source currency is USD. This new program should be able to convert from any of the included currencies to any other. A more comprehensive data file is provided to help with this stage of the project.

## Constraints ##
