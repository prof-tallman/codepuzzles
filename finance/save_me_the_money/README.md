These stages are friendly suggestions to help new programmers. Skilled students are allowed to complete the project in any order; and they might find better ways to solve the requirements.
1. ***AI Does My HW***: Print out the default monthly payment in addition to the interest amount and principal portion for the first payment. Hardcode the loan parameters: total borrowed, APR, and loan term (number of months).
2. ***Script Kiddie***: Create an amortization table that contains one row for every month in the loan. The amortization table should list the payment number, the payment amount, the interst amount, the principal portion, and the remaining balance. Continue to use hardcoded loan parameters.
3. ***Professional***: The amortization table is too long to display on the screen. Instead, save the table to a text file on disk. Print the details for the first five payments and the last five payments to the screen. Continue to use hardcoded parameters.
4. ***1337 H@cker***: Instead of using hardcoded parameters, take command line aguments for the total borrowed, APR, and the loan term. In addition to printing the first and last five rows of the amortization table, also print the total amount paid in interest.
5. ***BONUS***: Add an optional fourth parameter that allows the user to specify an extra monthly payment. Assume that the same extra payment will be made every month for the life of the loan.
