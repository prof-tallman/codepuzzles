# Matrix Multiplication #
Write a program that multiplies two matrices together.

A matrix is a rectangular arrangement of numbers in rows and columns. In order to multiply two matrices:
- The number of columns in the first matrix must equal the number of rows in the second matrix.
- If the first matrix is $m \times n$ and the second is $n \times k$, the resulting matrix will be $m \times k$.
- The element at position $(i,j)$ in the result is found by:
  - Taking the i-th row from the first matrix and the j-th column from the second matrix.
  - Multiplying each pair of corresponding elements.
  - Adding up all those products (this is the dot product of the row and column).

For example, multiplying a $2\times3$ matrix by a $3\times2$ matrix:
$$\begin{bmatrix}1&2&3\\4&5A6\end{bmatrix}\times\begin{bmatrix}7&8\\9&10\\11&12\end{bmatrix}=$$
